# NotAnotherMovieDb

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
An app that lets the user select a series of filters to randomly select a suggested movie on whatever streaming services they may have. These filters include: Genre, Streaming Services these titles are on, release year, actors, and directors.
The movie is randomly presented on a spinning wheel like its a game-show.

USER STORY:
As an indecisive movie lover, I want to not spend the length of a movie choosing which movie to watch so that I can watch more movies. 
The motivation for development is we consistently spend the average length of a movie picking which movie to watch.
