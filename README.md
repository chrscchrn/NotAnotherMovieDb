# Not Another Movie Database!

An app that lets the user select a series of filters to randomly select a suggested movie on whatever streaming services they may have. These filters include: Genre, Streaming Services these titles are on, release year, actors, and directors. The movie is randomly presented on a spinning wheel like its a game-show.
